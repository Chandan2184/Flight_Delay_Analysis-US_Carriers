Analyzing Flight Delays in U.S. Domestic Carriers (Julia)

This project provides a descriptive analysis of flight delays among U.S. domestic carriers. The analysis was conducted using the Julia programming language.

The primary goal is to understand historical trends , rather than to perform real-time predictions. The insights gathered from this analysis are intended to provide a foundation for future work, such as building predictive models, guiding automation projects, or developing AI-based planning tools


Dataset Description
 
The analysis is based on the Flight Delay Dataset found on Kaggle, which originates from the BTS TranStats On-Time Performance database.


Scope: The dataset contains flight-level data from numerous airlines and airports throughout 2024.


Size: It is a comprehensive dataset with over 7 million rows and 35 columns.


Key Features: Includes information on Airline, Flight Number, Origin, Destination, Scheduled & Actual Times, and Delay (Min).
